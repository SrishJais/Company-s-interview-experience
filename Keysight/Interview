Address of a computer related to network
Why ip address is required if we already have mac address

Atlast he asked me a dsa question:- Length of longest repeating substring
I told him O(n2) approach, although i had knowledge about the O(n) approach using KMP algorithm (Mainly asked during MAANG interviews), 
After telling him the approach I asked if i should write the code (pen and paper based) but he said no, and 
asked a follow up question that what is the maximum length of substring that you should check. 
My response: we need to check substring of max len n/2 because if the len of substring is greater than n/2 then it can't be repeated and we can simply exclude it from our search space.
