When I gave my interview, he first asked me where I was from and to introduce myself. Then he looked at my resume.

First he asked me if I know SQL. As I said yes he asked me indexing and use of database. Types of indexing.

Then he went to topics for the role requirements. He asked questions in web security, cache and cookies. What happens to cache in incognito mode. Browser history.

Difference between cache and cookies.

When we log in a page, and we open the page again how the data is fetched. And the difference if the same thing happens in incognito mode.

Difference between javascript and react as it was in my resume. He asked a question that if I created a moving circle using both, which will be faster to load in the browser. 

Encryption and Hashing. Difference between them and different types of them.
